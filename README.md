Project name: **Rock Paper Scissors GO!!!**

Description:

Pick a symbol between 3, either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer will also pick a choice between the 3 (the user won’t see this happening). The game is a best of 3. After each attempt, show who won between you and the computer. Then if you (the player) win the game, alert “Congratulations! You won!”. And if you lost the game, alert “Unlucky! Maybe next time”. There will be another mode where you can play as PvP (Player vs. Player). It would be available only locally on the user’s computer (not online). Also, players can choose their own username before the game starts. Furthermore, players can agree on a timer to set, if the timer ends before a player chooses a symbol, they would lose that round.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1- Browser will have two buttons in the middle of the screen, pvp, and vs. computer, then the user chooses the mode he wants.

2- If PvP is chosen, the first player will be prompted to enter their username, then the second player will do the same. (Player will also be prompted to enter a username in vs. computer mode).

3- Username(s) will appear in the top left corner, and the Game name will appear in the middle of the screen (Rock Paper Scissors GO!!!)

4- Players will be asked whether they want a timer or not. If they do want a timer, the browser will ask them to choose the amount of seconds that the timer will run, before someone’s turn ends and loses that round.

5- If the timer is to be shown, it will appear on the top right corner of the screen.

6- If they don’t, then there will be no timer displayed on screen during the rounds. (There will be no timer option for the computer mode)

7- Player 1 will be able to choose between a symbol of a Rock, Paper, or Scissors, their choice will be hidden, then Player 2 will choose his symbol (or the computer).

8- Symbols will appear in the middle of the screen, right next to each other starting with the Rock, then the paper, and ending with the scissors. (Name and image of the corresponding option)

9- Winner of the round will be declared by an alert.

10- After all rounds are completed, Winner of the match will be declared by an alert saying “Congratulations! ”, username x, “ You won!”. (or if lost vs. computer, by an alert saying “Unlucky! Maybe next time”)

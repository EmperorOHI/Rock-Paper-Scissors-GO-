Project name: Rock Paper Scissors GO!!!

Description:

Pick a symbol between 3, either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The server will also pick a choice between the 3 (the user won’t see this happening). The game is a best of 3. After each attempt, show who won between you and the server. Then if you (the player) win the game, prompt a pop-up that says “Congratulations! You won!”. And if you lost the game, prompt “Unlucky! Maybe next time”. There will be another mode where you can play as pvp(player vs. player). It would be available only locally on the user’s computer (not online). Also, players can choose their own username before the game starts. Furthermore, players can agree on a timer to set, if the timer ends before a player chooses a symbol, they would lose that round. 

Players will be able to choose between a symbol of a Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
Players will know when they win by a prompt up-window saying “Congratulations! You won!”.
Players will know when they lost by a prompt up-window saying “Unlucky! Maybe next time”.
When the first player makes his choice, it will be hidden until the second player plays, then it will be revealed for both players (And the winner will be declared). 
Once players enter their username, the program will ask them whether or not they would want a timer in their game.
If the players want a timer, the program will ask them to choose the amount of seconds that the timer will run, before someone’s turn ends and loses.
